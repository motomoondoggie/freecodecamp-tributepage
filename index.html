          <p class="myth-info" id="tribute-info">Horus is The Ancient Egyptian God of the sky, and is king of the Gods. Pharaohs of Egypt had a 'Horus name', or a name they took that identified the pharaoh with Horus - as the Pharaoh is the reincarnation of horus.

          <h4 class="myth-info" id="story">Horus</h4>
            <p class="myth-info">Horus is the son of Osiris and Isis. Sometimes Horus' name is written Harseisis or HerusaAset to reflect he is the son of Isis. Sometimes his name is written 'Heru-pa-khered' (Harpocrates to the Greeks), or Horus the Younger, to indentify him from his uncle, Horus the Elder, God of Istillneedtofindoutwhat.</p>
            <p class="myth-info">After Set, Horus's uncle and Osiris' brother, murdered Osiris and usurped kingship of Egypt, Horus was raised in hiding by his mother Isis and the Goddesses Selket and Neith. </p>
            <p class="myth-info">When Horus became of age, he went to go take his father's kingdom back from Set. One version of the story goes, he takes Set to court over control of the kingdom. The Gods presiding over the case agreed that Horus should have control, but the supreme sun God Ra, disagreed and said that Horus was too young for that, and that power should stay with Set.  They then have to compete against each other in many battles and each time Horus wins it. However, Ra kept saying no, that power should stay with Set.</p>
            <p class="myth-info">The entire time that Set had control, the kingdom suffered famine and drought. And the longer the contests went on, the longer the subjects would suffer. So after Horus had bested Set in one of their many battles, Isis had tricked Set into rightfully restoring the ownership of the kingdom and ousted himself in front of the court of the other gods. From then on Horus ruled over the kingdom as the rightful ruler.  </p>
            <p class="myth-info">Set is given the foreign desert lands to rule, along with foreign goddesses as consorts. He was associated with the deserts, and foreign kingdoms.</p>
            <p class="myth-info">Horus reinstated Osirus's policies, and brought back peace, order, and prosperity.</p>
